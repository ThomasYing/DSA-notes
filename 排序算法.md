| In-place merge sort |    —    |     —     | $nlog^2n$ |   1    |  Yes   |       Merging       | Can be implemented as a stable sort based on stable in-place merging. |
|      Heapsort       | $nlogn$ |  $nlogn$  |  $nlogn$  |   1    |   No   |      Selection      |                                                              |
|     Merge sort      | $nlogn$ |  $nlogn$  |  $nlogn$  |  *n*   |  Yes   |       Merging       | Highly parallelizable (up to *O*(log *n*) using the Three Hungarian's Algorithm) |
|       Timsort       |   *n*   |  $nlogn$  |  $nlogn$  |  *n*   |  Yes   | Insertion & Merging | Makes *n-1* comparisons when the data is already sorted or reverse sorted. |
|      Quicksort      | $nlogn$ |  $nlogn$  |   $n^2$   | $logn$ |   No   |    Partitioning     | Quicksort is usually done in-place with *O*(log *n*) stack space. |
|      Shellsort      | $nlogn$ | $n^{4/3}$ | $n^{3/2}$ |   1    |   No   |      Insertion      |                       Small code size.                       |
|   Insertion sort    |   *n*   |   $n^2$   |   $n^2$   |   1    |  Yes   |      Insertion      | *O*(n + d), in the worst case over sequences that have *d* inversions. |
|     Bubble sort     |   *n*   |   $n^2$   |   $n^2$   |   1    |  Yes   |     Exchanging      |                       Tiny code size.                        |
|   Selection sort    |  $n^2$  |   $n^2$   |   $n^2$   |   1    |   No   |      Selection      | Stable with O(n) extra space, when using linked lists, or when made as a variant of Insertion Sort instead of swapping the two items. |

注：

a.稳定的排序：归并排序、插入排序、冒泡排序
